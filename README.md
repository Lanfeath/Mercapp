<h1>Mercapp</h1>

This is the application I created for the validation exam of my Studi exam: application programmer in Python.

<h2>Project description:</h2>
The aim is to develop an application for "Mercadona" a spanish company who is known to make a lot of discounts actions on their products.<br>
They want to get a "greener" dimensions and therefore remove the paper tracts to go on the Web.<br>
The customer should be able to see the entire catalogue with the products and the one in promotions should be with the price in bold and red.<br>
An administrator must be able to login and add some new products or promotions.

- a back end --> Flask 
- a database --> PostgreSQL is mandatory.

<h2>How to install and run the project:</h2>
